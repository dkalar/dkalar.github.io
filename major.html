            Along with my major, I am minoring in Statistics. To help with this, I am mostly taking classes that
            specialize in applied math. The other branch, pure math, is more suited for people who wish
            to teach math in some capacity. My goal personally is to eventually find a job as an actuary or
            something similarly involved heavily with math. Along the way, I have also taken classes in computer science, 
            music, and history.
