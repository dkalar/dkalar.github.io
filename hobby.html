            One of my hobbies has been playing music on a few different instruments. I have played the
            trumpet for about 10 years, the french horn for about 6 years, and now the guitar for about a
            year. I am focusing on the guitar for now, but I may try to learn a new instrument sometime in the future.

            I needed to create another paragraph to demonstrate inline styles so here we are.
